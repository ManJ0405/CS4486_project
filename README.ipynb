    "# Skin Cancer Classification using Deep Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Overview\n",
    "This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the classification of dermoscopic images into eight different diagnostic categories of skin cancer. The model is trained to identify various types of skin lesions from medical images, which is crucial for early detection and diagnosis of skin cancer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "The dataset consists of dermoscopic images categorized into eight different classes:\n",
    "- Actinic Keratosis (AK)\n",
    "- Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC)\n",
    "- Benign Keratosis (BKL)\n",
    "- Dermatofibroma (DF)\n",
    "- Melanoma (MEL)\n",
    "- Melanocytic Nevus (NV)\n",
    "- Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC)\n",
    "- Vascular Lesion (VASC)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Characteristics\n",
    "- Training set: 24,499 images with imbalanced class distribution\n",
    "- Test set: 800 images (100 images per class, evenly distributed)\n",
    "- Image size: 84x84 pixels with 3 color channels (RGB)\n",
