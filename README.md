# Skin Cancer Classification using Deep Learning

## Project Overview
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the classification of dermoscopic images into eight different diagnostic categories of skin cancer. The model is trained to identify various types of skin lesions from medical images, which is crucial for early detection and diagnosis of skin cancer.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of dermoscopic images categorized into eight different classes:
- Actinic Keratosis (AK)
- Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC)
- Benign Keratosis (BKL)
- Dermatofibroma (DF)
- Melanoma (MEL)
- Melanocytic Nevus (NV)
- Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC)
- Vascular Lesion (VASC)

### Dataset Characteristics
- Training set: 24,499 images with imbalanced class distribution
- Test set: 800 images (100 images per class, evenly distributed)
- Image size: 84x84 pixels with 3 color channels (RGB)

## Model Architecture
The implemented CNN architecture consists of:
- Three convolutional blocks, each containing:
  - Two Conv2D layers with ReLU activation
  - Batch Normalization
  - Max Pooling
  - Dropout for regularization
- Fully connected layers:
  - Flatten layer
  - Dense layer (512 units) with ReLU activation
  - Final dense layer with softmax activation for 8-class classification

## Training Process
- Data preprocessing:
  - Image normalization (pixel values scaled to [0,1])
  - One-hot encoding of labels
  - Handling of imbalanced class distribution
- Training configuration:
  - Optimizer: Adam with learning rate 0.001
  - Loss function: Categorical Crossentropy
  - Batch size: 32
  - Maximum epochs: 50
  - Validation split: 20%

### Callbacks
- Early Stopping: Monitors validation loss with patience of 10 epochs
- Learning Rate Reduction: Reduces learning rate by factor of 0.5 when validation loss plateaus

## Evaluation Metrics
The model's performance is evaluated using multiple metrics:
- Classification Report:
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-score
  - Support
- Confusion Matrix
- ROC-AUC Score (One-vs-Rest)
- Overall Accuracy
- Per-class metrics for each skin cancer type

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)
- Pickle
- scikit-learn

## Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ManJ0405/CS4486_project.git
cd CS4486_project

```

## Usage
1. Ensure all required packages are installed
2. Run the preprocessing script to prepare the data
3. Execute the model training notebook
4. The trained model will be saved automatically
5. Evaluation metrics will be displayed after training

## Results
The model's performance is evaluated using:
- Test accuracy
- Test loss
- Training and validation accuracy/loss curves
- Detailed classification metrics for each class
- ROC-AUC score for multi-class classification

## Future Improvements
